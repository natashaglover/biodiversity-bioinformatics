## General objectives

Understand the principles of graph-based orthology delineation using OrthoDB as an example; learn how to browse and programmatically query OrthoDB; learn how to use BUSCO to assess genomics data quality; learn how to formulate comparative genomics questions, develop and apply approaches to address them (with a focus on using orthology data), and then critically interpret them, through case studies from arthropods.
