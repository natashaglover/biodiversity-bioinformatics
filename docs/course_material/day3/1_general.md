## General objectives

Understand the importance of gene and genome duplication in comparative genomics; understand the difficulty of comparing "function" between homologous genes, and know some tools to do so.

## Course material

### Lecture 1: Function in model vs non-model organisms

[:fontawesome-solid-file-pdf: Download the presentation](../../assets/pdf/day3/course_Marc_ROBINSON-RECHAVI_lecture1.pdf){: .md-button }  <!-- AT. Update path/move presentation into the parts with exercises? -->

**Learning outcomes**

* Notion of "function" for genes
* Sources of information on functions
* Annotation and biocuration
* Transfer and reliability of annotations in non-model species

### Lecture 2: Finding information about gene function at small scale

[:fontawesome-solid-file-pdf: Download the presentation](../../assets/pdf/day3/course_Marc_ROBINSON-RECHAVI_lecture2.pdf){: .md-button }  <!-- AT. Update path/move presentation into the parts with exercises? -->

**Learning outcomes**

* Orthologue conjecture
* Functional enrichment
* Evolution of gene expression:
	* Gene expression as a quantitative trait
	* Conservation among species (clustering per organ not per species)
	* Fast evolution of testis genes
	* Convergent evolution: venom glands

### Lecture 3: Gene and genome duplication

[:fontawesome-solid-file-pdf: Download the presentation](../../assets/pdf/day3/course_Marc_ROBINSON-RECHAVI_lecture3.pdf){: .md-button }  <!-- AT. Update path/move presentation into the parts with exercises? -->

**Learning outcomes**

* Types of duplication: tandem, retroposition, whole genome
* Biased gene retention
* Evolution after duplication: sub- and neo-functionalisation
* Impact of duplication on biology:
	* Large gene family expansions
	* Whole genome duplications in eukaryote evolution

## Course gitlab repository

The gitlab repository to run all the practicals is available at [https://github.com/BgeeDB/Biodiversity-Bioinformatics](https://github.com/BgeeDB/Biodiversity-Bioinformatics).

!!! note
	Remember to open a Gitpod workspace before starting the practicals. Click [here](../../precourse.md#software) for more information on Gitpod workspace.

## Provided data files and scripts

You can find the Exercise 3 datasets [here](https://github.com/BgeeDB/Biodiversity-Bioinformatics/tree/main/data) and the R script to use in Exercise 2 [here](https://github.com/BgeeDB/Biodiversity-Bioinformatics/blob/main/scripts/pca_generation.R).
