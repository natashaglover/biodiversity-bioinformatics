## UNIX

As is stated in the course prerequisites at the [announcement web page](https://www.sib.swiss/training/), we expect participants to have a basic understanding of working with the command line on UNIX-based systems. You can test your UNIX skills with a quiz [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2BEWeOKLbIRGBT_aDEGPce1FOaVYBbhBiaqcaHoBKNB27MQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). If you don't have experience with UNIX command line, or if you're unsure whether you meet the prerequisites, follow our [online UNIX tutorial](https://edu.sib.swiss/pluginfile.php/2878/mod_resource/content/4/couselab-html/content.html).

## Technical requirements

Your computer should have an internet connection, and at least 8 GB RAM, 50 GB free disk space.

## Software

Most of the exercises will be run on [gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/). To log in, you first need to create a [github](https://github.com/) or a [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) account. Before the course, make sure you can comfortably work with command line, R and git repository.

<!-- You will also need a location version of [R]() installed on your computer -->

<!-- 
Before the course, make sure you can comfortably work on a remote server. This means that you can approach it through the shell, modify scripts and transfer files. We can recommend `atom` for Linux and Mac, and `Notepad ++` in combination with MobaXterm for Windows. We will be visualising our results with IGV. Therefore, install in your computer:
